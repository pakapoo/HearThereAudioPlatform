# Hear There - a Sharing Platform for Audio Guides (Android App)
#### Capstone Project of NTU Information Management, IM 3009/IM 4001: Project on Information Management, Prof. Wei, Chih-Ping

### Motivation
* When traveling, due to limited time, tourists can only skim the surface and are unable to delve into various aspects of the attractions.
* Most independent travelers have a need for guidance, but they want to maintain privacy and have their own space during the journey, not wanting a guide always by their side.
* A single professional guide has limited knowledge about the attractions, making it difficult to cover multiple facets.
* Professional guides or local residents, although possessing extensive knowledge about many attractions, are unable to disseminate it to a wider audience.

### Concept
Through a voice-guided sharing platform, professional guiding knowledge can leverage the benefits of the sharing economy, instantly meeting the knowledge needs of tourists and overcoming the limitations of manpower and time in traditional guiding. The platform facilitates the exchange of local knowledge, uncovering lesser-known aspects of attractions.
This concept can also be extended to various aspects of guided tours in venues such as museums and zoos. By incorporating auditory experiences and combining them with knowledge sharing, it provides users with a unique and enriched experience.

### Target
* Through a voice-guided sharing platform, establish a connection between tourists and guides.
* Allow tourists to gain a deeper understanding of various aspects of each attraction through audio files within the application.
* Enable guides or local residents to share their knowledge about attractions with tourists through the application. This is a way to make travel more in-depth and interactive for everyone involved.

### Functionalities
